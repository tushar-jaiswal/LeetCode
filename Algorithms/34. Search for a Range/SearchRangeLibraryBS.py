# Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

# If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].

# You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
# Output: [3,4]

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
# Output: [-1,-1]

# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [], target = 0
# Output: [-1,-1]

# Constraints:
# 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
# nums is a non-decreasing array.
# -10^9 <= target <= 10^9

# Runtime complexity: O(log n)
# Space complexity: O(1) 

class Solution:
    def searchRange(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left = bisect.bisect_left(nums, target)
        right = bisect.bisect_right(nums, target)
        return [left, right - 1] if left != right else [-1, -1]
